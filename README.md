# Social-Distancer
Let's Hack COVID-19 Hackathon Project - AI Powered Social Distancing surveillance system in Offices and Public Places 

I along with my team worked on building a model that can check social distancing among people in public or private settings using the input from CCTV cameras. This was done using YOLO algorithm, OpenCV and other required python libraries. The model can be deployed in offices and public places.
